## Definiciones

* **Populism**: a political ideology where citizens are mistreated by a small circle of elites who can be overthrown if the people work together.
* **Macroeconomics**: a branch of economics that deals with the performance, structure, behavior and decision-making of an economy as a whole rather than individual markets.
* **Macroeconomic populism**: an approach to economics that emphasizes growth and income redistribution but deemphasizes the risks of inflation, deficit finance, external constraints, and the reaction of economic agents to aggresive nonmarket policies.
* **Fiscal policy**: the means by which a government adjusts its spending levels and tax rates to monitor and influence a nation's economy.
* **Inflation**: the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and the purchasing power of currency is falling.
* **Expansionary policies**: a macroeconomic policy that seeks to expand the money supply to encourage economic growth or combat inflationary price increases.
* **Foreign exchange contraints**: the controls imposed by a government on the purchase or sale of foreign currencies.
* **Real wages**: wages adjusted for inflation, in terms of how many goods and services can be bought.
* **Reformist policies**: policies that support a gradual reform rather than abolition or revolution.
* **Political mobilization**: the process by which citizens are selected for involvement in politics, the attempt to influence the existing distribution of power.
* **Deficit finance**: practice in which a government spends more money than it receives as revenue (the difference comes from borrowing or minting new funds); a plan to put more money in the economy than it takes out by taxation.
* **Capital flight**: when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country due to an event of economic consequence.

## Resumen
Latin America's economic history seems to repeat itself endlessly following irregular and dramatic cycles. This occurs especially with respect to the use of populist macroeconomic policies for distributing resources. Policymakers adopt economic programs that rely on the use of expansive fiscal and credit policies and overvalued currency to accelerate growth and redistribute income. Usually there is no concern on fiscal and foreign exchange constraints when implementing these populist policies. After some growth, bottlenecks develop and result in the plummeting of real wages and payment difficulties. The outcome is usually inflation, crisis or an economic collapse. After this outcome, usually they require help from the IMF. The self-destructive feature of populism is particularly apparent when income per capita and real wages decline in the final days of implementing that kind of policies.

People who sympathize with populism say that external factors and politics are the reason for the demise. Clearly this is important too. But the main reason for destabilization is the result of unsustainable policies such as populist ones.

How else can one explain this cycle. Do policymakers forget? Or maybe they are ignorant to the mechanics of an economic populism? The goal of this conference is to analyze the general features of macroeconomic populism in Latin America and document the regularities and peculiarties of a large number of populist episodes. The case studies show a striking similarity of populist policies across Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Nicaragua: the expansionary policies and how foreign exchange constraints and extreme inflation forced a program of violent real wage cuts that ended in massive political instability. The study focuses on the macroeconomic sphere of populism.

Populism is usually aimed at the working class. It involves political mobilization, recurrent rhetoric and symbols designed to inspire people, reformist policies tailored to promote development without explosive class conflict; responding to problems of underdevelopment through ameliorative redistributive measures. Some argue that populist programs frequently overlap with socialism. The redistributive objective is the central part of the paradigm.

Macroeconomic populism is an approach to economics that emphasizes growth and income redistribution but deemphasizes the risks of inflation, deficit finance, external constraints, and the reaction of economic agents to aggresive nonmarket policies.

The most important features of the populist paradigm can be summarized as follows:

1. People are unhappy with the economy's performance; there is a strong feeling that things can be better. There is a highly unequal income distribution providing the appeal for a radically different economic program.
2. Policymakers reject the conservative paradigm and ignore the existence of constraints on macroeconomic policy. The risks of deficit are portrayed as exaggerated or unfounded. According to populist policymakers, expansion is not inflationary because there is always room to squeeze profit margins by controlling price.
3. Populist programs emphasize reactivation, redistribution of income and restructuring the economy.

Once in power, populist policymakers implement ambitious economic programs aimed at redistributing income, creating jobs and accelerating growth. There are four distinct phases common to the vast majority of experiences:

1. Policymakers are fully determined in their diagnosis and prescription: growth of output, real wages, and employment are high and the macroeconomic policies are nothing but successful. Controls assure inflation is not a problem. Shortages are fixed through imports.
2. The economy runs into bottlenecks because of a strong demand for domestic goods, because of a growing lack of foreign exchange. Low levels of inventories are now a source of problems. Price becomes realigned and devaluated and exchange control and protection becomes necessary. Inflation increases significantly but wages keep up.
3. Lots of shortages, extreme acceleration of inflation, huge foreign exchange gap lead to capital flight and demonetization of the economy. Steep decline in tax collection and increase in subsidy costs. Government tries to stabilize by cutting subsidies and by a real depreciation. Real wages fall, policies become unstable. The government is in a bad situation.
4. Orthodox stabilization takes over under a new government. The IMF is neacted. The politics and economics stay depressed because of low investment and capital flight. The extremity of real wage declines is due to a simple fact: capital is mobile across borders but labor is not. Capital can flee but labor is trapped.
