## The Industrial Revolution and Transportation Technology
The IR transformed the nature of the intercontinental trading system:

1. It created a massive assymetry within the world economic system where GB would embark in sustained per capita income growth (industrialization, military and political power).

2. The unprecedented shock impacted worldwide and was greatly magnified by the new technologies of the IR, especially the steam engine which integrate international commodity markets (transportation technology).

**Argument: better transportation would open national economies to international trade in ways that differed radically from what had gone before.**

Previous globalizations were geopolitical, from violence and conquests. The globalization of the 19th century was in turn largely driven by technology (however violence and conquests continued).

The transport revolutions were preceeded by the improvement of roads and surfaces years prior. People had started using canals and building steamships to navigate rivers and seas. Several innovations had allowed for bigger and lighter ships. As of late 1874, steamships carried >90% of the cotton, ginger, indigo, rapeseed, tea, cowhides and teelseed. Navigating through water was ever easier than before.

The other major development in transportation was the railroad. The growth in railway mileage was phenomenal, especially in the US where trains would play a major role in creating a national market. The decades prior to WWI saw an explosion of railway building. However, overland transport remained much more expensive than ocean transport. Yet railways and canals did more of the work in integrating global commodity markets than the steamships. There was an unprecedented, dramatic and worldwide decline in international transportation costs in the four decades leading up to WW1.

## Bulk commodities and Heckscher-Ohlin Effects
When transport costs decline, trade volumes increase (ccpp). But the transport revolutions also led to a greater variety of goods being traded and **this had profound implications for the world economy.** When intercontinental transport costs were very high, goods were expensive on destination continents before they were not produced there at all. This means that they did not displace local production because they were largely noncompeting. As late as the middle of the 18th century, a small number of commodities that were clearly noncompeting (eg. pepper, tea, coffee, etc.) accounted for more tha nhalf of European imports from the Americas and Asia. Long distance trade began to displace domestic producers in large numbers as European land became in direct competition with the land from the New World. 

When analizing the land-labor ratio in GB one can see the rising demand and price for food as it naturally occurs in a closed economy and how after 1840 the relative price of food stopped rising and eventually started to fall while the ratio of wages to land rents started to rise. This implies that **at some point, GB commodity and factor prices stopped being determined by the British endowments of land and labor and this reflects the opening up of GB's economy to long-distance trade in now competing commodities such as grain. Domestic relative prices were now increasingly determined by world market conditions rather than by domestic supply and demand.** As transportation costs fell, however, food supplies from the New World prevented GB food prices from rising further and led them to fall eventually.

But this didn't only happen in GB. Williamson (2002) presents the w/r ratio (unskilled, urban wage : returns to agricultural land).
European wages (low because no land available for workers) should have caught up with the New World wages (high because a lot of land and resources), while New World land prices (low) should have caught up with European land prices (high). This is what is supposed to happen in times of globalization and it indeed happened to many countries.

Third World countries also experienced similar trends because of commodity market integration. 

## Nineteenth century imperialism
The IR led to economic asymmetries as well as to military and political asymmetries. UK, France and Russia exploited these asymmetries to expand into Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, the US was embarking on a similar program of imperial expansion at the expense of Native Americans.
